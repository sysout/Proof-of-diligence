## When to sell bitcoin for FIAT
- when bitcoin price is 2~3 times of the mining cost
  * Use Antminer A9 14TH/s as an example. Suppose the shelf life of the Antminer S9 is 1 year. The cost of mining
    + (1400+0.01*1.4*24*365)/(14*12.5*6*24*365/29254727/2) = 9685 USD
    + 1400 is the cost of Antminer. 0.01 is the electricity cost. 1.4 KWH
    + 14 is the hashrate, 12.5 is the block reward, 6 block per hour
    + 29254727 is the network hashrate as of April 23, 2018
    + 2 is the estimated hashrate growth factor
